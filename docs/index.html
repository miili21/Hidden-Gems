<h1>Planteamiento de la Investigación</h1>
<div id="planteamiento-del-problema" class="section level2">
<h2>1.Planteamiento del problema</h2>
<p>La cantidad de películas y series que hay en Netflix son miles y de
distintos géneros, países y años de lanzamiento. Sin embargo, hay
algunas producciones que alcanzan alta popularidad y son ampliamente
recomendadas, mientras que otras a pesar de tener buena calidad y alta
valoración reciben menos atención del público. Este desequilibrio motiva
a la pregunta de ¿qué características del contenido son las que influyen
en la visibilidad y éxito de las producciones de la plataforma, cómo
pueden identificarse y promoverse aquellas obras de alta calidad que
pasan desapercibidas?</p>
<p>El problema principal radica en que gran parte del consumo de los
usuarios proviene de sistemas de recomendación automatizados, los cuales
tienden a favorecer los títulos que ya son populares. Éste fenómeno crea
un ciclo de visibilidad desigual, donde las producciones con menores
posición inicial permanecen ocultas y no logran alcanzar al público
potencial, reduciendo la diversidad del consumo audiovisuaL.</p>
<p>Ante esta situación, se prefiere escoger un enfoque empírico a partir
de información concreta obtenida del dataset, aplicando limpieza,
análisis exploratorio multivariado y criterios reproducibles para
rankear posibles gemas, buscando observar patrones y resultados reales.
La propuesta busca analizar los datos del catálogo para identificar los
factores que determinan la popularidad o invisibilidad de una
producción, y detectar de forma efectiva las “gemas ocultas“, es decir,
aquellas películas y series con buenas valoraciones pero baja
popularidad.</p>

<h1>Objetivos</h1>
<div id="objetivo-general" class="section level2">
<h2>Objetivo general</h2>
<p>Analizar los datos del catálogo de Netflix para identificar los
factores relacionados a la popularidad y visibilidad de las producciones
e identificar un conjunto reproducible de “gemas ocultas”.</p>
</div>
<div id="objetivos-específicos" class="section level2">
<h2>Objetivos específicos</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Realizar la carga y limpieza reproducible del dataset base,
asegurando nombres consistentes y formatos adecuados (fechas, duración,
géneros).</p></li>
<li><p>Analizar cómo ha sido la evolución temporal de las
incorporaciones al catálogo y las tendencias del tipo de contenido
(Movie vs TV Show).</p></li>

<h1>Marco metodológico</h1>
<div id="enfoque-de-la-investigación" class="section level2">
<h2>Enfoque de la investigación</h2>
<p>El enfoque es cuantitativo y descriptivo. Con el objetivo principal
de medir y explicar relaciones entre variables numéricas y cualitativas;
además, las elecciones de umbral de gemas, manejo de outliers, dependen
de estadísticas reproducibles y cuantificables.</p>
</div>
<div id="tipo-de-investigación" class="section level2">
<h2>Tipo de investigación</h2>
<p>La investigación es descriptiva y correlacional con elementos
exploratorios, se enfoca en describir el catálogo, explorar distintas
variables y analizar asociaciones y tendencias temporales que podrán
servir de base para trabajos predictivos futuros.</p>
</div>
<div id="periodo-de-referencia" class="section level2">
<h2>Periodo de referencia</h2>
<p>El periodo de análisis viene de las fechas disponibles en
<code>date_added</code> y <code>release_year</code>. Se sugiere usar
todo el rango disponible en el dataset para maximizar la inferencia
histórica, y subanálisis por década para mejorar interpretabilidad. La
elección por décadas facilita comparaciones históricas sin suponer
continuidad mensual uniforme.</p>
</div>
<div id="procesamiento-y-análisis-de-datos-pasos-reproducibles"
class="section level2">
<h2>Procesamiento y análisis de datos (pasos reproducibles)</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Carga de librerías y dataset</p></li>
<li><p>clean_names() para uniformizar nombres.</p></li>
<li><p>Renombrado condicional (soportar esquema en inglés y el script

<li><p>Normalización de duration (extraer minutos para películas;
extraer número de temporadas para series).</p></li>
<li><p>Separación de listed_in/genres y country/production_countries con
separate_rows().</p></li>
<li><p>Manejo de valores faltantes (NA) en clasificaciones y
descripciones, detección de duplicados y eliminación basada en

<p>Con estos datos, se puede comprender diversos datos importante para
el conocimiento de la data:</p>
<p>Año de Lanzamiento El análisis de esta variable revela una fuerte
concentración en contenido contemporáneo. La mediana en 2018 y la media
en 2016, sugieren que la mitad de las producciones más recientes se han
estrenado en 2018 o posteriormente.El rango intercuartílico pequeño (5
años) refleja que la mayoría de producciones se concentran entre 2015 y
2020. La presencia de valores atípicos (outliers), representados por
producciones muy antiguas o muy recientes, explica la dispersión fuera
de este intervalo, pero no alteran la tendencia central del
catálogo.</p>
<p>Tiempo de Duración (Películas) Las películas presentan un tiempo
promedio de 80 minutos y mediana de 90 minutos, lo que refleja que
predominan producciones de una duracion estandar, ni muy cortas ni
excesivamente largas. La diferencia entre mínimo y máximo indica la
existencia de outliers (películas extremadamente cortas o muy
extensas).</p>
<p>Popularidad TMDB El puntaje promedio de 28.69 es significativamente
superior a la mediana de 9.73, lo que indica una distribución sesgada a
la derecha.Este patrón estadístico coincide con la realidad de la
plataforma, donde un conjunto de grandes éxitos globales destaca
notablemente sobre la popularidad general del catálogo.</p>
<p>Puntaje TMDB Los puntajes muestran una valoración más consistente y
homogénea del contenido. La mediana (6.9) se encuentra muy próxima a la
media (6.62), lo que implica que los puntajes de las producciones se
concentran de manera estrecha alrededor de estos valores medios. El
rango intercuartílico de 1.4 confirma esta baja dispersión, sugiriendo
que la mayoría de las producciones obtienen calificaciones de calidad
relativamente similares. Esta consistencia indica que el catálogo
mantiene un umbral de calidad homogéneo.</p>

<p>2.Comedy</p>
<p>3.Thriller</p>

<p>Los gráficos de barras muestran la evolución del éxito por género a
lo largo de las décadas, diferenciando entre películas y series:</p>
<p>El análisis de la popularidad promedio de los géneros revela una
clara concentración de las películas más populares en las décadas
recientes, principalmente la de 2010 y 2020, con las películas más
antiguas prácticamente sin representación en los puntajes altos. Aunque
la mayoría de los géneros se sitúan en un rango de popularidad promedio
bajo, los picos más altos, que superan las 100.000 unidades, están
impulsados consistentemente por géneros como Acción, Crimen, Animación y
Ciencia Ficción.</p>

<p>El análisis de las series en Netflix muestra una situación similar a
la de las películas, con la popularidad promedio concentrada en las
décadas de 2010 y 2020. El rango de popularidad es muy amplio, pero la
mayoría de las series se agrupan en valores bajos (cerca de 0). Los
picos de popularidad más altos, que superan las 50.000 unidades, están
impulsados por géneros como Crimen, Drama y Acción, y de manera notoria,
el género de Ciencia Ficción, que alcanza algunos de los valores más
altos. Al igual que en las películas, las series de las décadas
anteriores a 2000 tienen una popularidad promedio muy baja o nula.</p>
<p>En conjunto, los resultados indican que la diversificación de géneros
ha sido clave en la expansión del catálogo, aunque los géneros
narrativos clásicos siguen concentrando el mayor éxito.</p>

<p>Este gráfico de líneas muestra tendencias opuestas en la duración
promedio del contenido a lo largo de las décadas. La duración promedio
de las películas (línea roja) ha ido disminuyendo constantemente desde
su punto máximo en los años 1960 (casi 140 minutos) hasta estabilizarse
en torno a los 100 minutos en la actualidad. Por otro lado, la duración
promedio de los episodios de las series (línea azul), aunque se mantuvo
baja en los 80 y 90, ha experimentado un ligero pero constante aumento
desde los 2000, sugiriendo que los episodios de series se han hecho un
poco más largos recientemente, mientras que las películas son cada vez
más cortas en promedio.</p>

<p>Este diagrama de burbujas, que compara la duración promedio con la
popularidad de las películas por década, revela que la mayor parte del
catálogo de Netflix se concentra en el contenido más reciente y corto.
Las burbujas más grandes, que representan la mayor cantidad de
películas, corresponden a las décadas de 2010 y 2020; estas películas
son las más cortas (cercanas a 100 minutos) y tienen una popularidad
promedio baja a moderada. Por otro lado, las películas más antiguas
(1960s y 1970s) tienen duraciones más largas (cercanas a 150 minutos) y,
aunque su popularidad es variada, la cantidad de títulos es mínima, lo
que demuestra que Netflix prioriza la cantidad de producciones actuales
y de duración estándar sobre el contenido histórico más extenso.</p>
<p>El resultado <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.0235\)</span>
establece que no existe una relación lineal significativa entre la
duración promedio de las películas y su nivel de popularidad. Al ser
positivo, sugiere una relación lineal directa muy débil.En términos
prácticos, el tiempo que dura una película (si son 90 o 150 minutos) no
es un factor determinante para predecir qué tan popular será en la
plataforma.</p>

<p>Este diagrama de burbujas, que compara la duración promedio de los
episodios con la popularidad de las series por década, muestra que la
popularidad más alta no se asocia a un patrón claro de duración. Las dos
burbujas más grandes, que representan la mayor cantidad de series
(décadas de 2010 y 2020), tienen una duración promedio muy similar
(alrededor de 38 a 40 minutos), pero su popularidad promedio varía
ligeramente. Los picos de popularidad son alcanzados por series de
décadas anteriores (1990s y 1980s), cuyas burbujas son mucho más
pequeñas (menos cantidad de series), con duraciones que varían entre los
25 y 35 minutos. Esto demuestra que la mayor parte del catálogo de
Netflix se centra en series con episodios de duración estándar (cerca de
40 minutos), pero la popularidad extrema es un fenómeno raro y disperso,
sin depender directamente de si el episodio es corto o largo.</p>

<p>Este diagrama de burbujas compara la popularidad promedio de
producciones por país en las últimas dos décadas. El gráfico muestra una
extrema concentración de la popularidad en las décadas de 2010 y 2020,
con la década de 2000 teniendo solo un punto atípico (CZ). La mayor
cantidad de producciones (tamaño de la burbuja) y los valores más altos
de popularidad promedio (color rojo intenso) se asocian principalmente
al código [es] (España) en ambas décadas (2010s y 2020s). Esto demuestra
que las producciones de España son las más voluminosas y, en promedio,
las más populares dentro de este conjunto de países. El resto de los
países tiene una cantidad de producciones mucho menor y su popularidad
promedio tiende a ser más baja (color rosa claro) y homogénea.</p>
